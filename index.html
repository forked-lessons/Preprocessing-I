  <h1>Bobba Fett</h1>
  <h2>The most impactful non-speaking character.</h2>
  <p>Bobba Fett is a well known character in Star Wars despite having an average of one word per movie. How is he this
    impactful, and why?</p>

  <h2>Why Hire Bobba?</h2>
  <p>Bobba Fett is one of the most recognizable characters in Star Wars. He speaks very few words, wears cool armor,
    and flies a really awesome ship. The inspiration behind this character was actually Clint Eastwood in "A Fistfull
    of Dollars." Although George Lucas did not envision the role of Bobba Fett as very large, as the story contined to
    unravel his part became much larger. In "The Clone Wars" Bobba is shown as a child with one speaking word, "Yep".
    For an introvert like me this is totally relatable, I too would like to convey the maximum amount of information in
    the least possible words.
    While Bobba has two different stories depending on wether you look at cannon or legends, I will focus mainly on the
    newer cannon story. Bobba watched Mace Windu kill his father Jango Fett at the battle of Geonosis. Since this
    moment Bobba sought to avenge his father and kill Mace Windu. Shortly after his fathers death Bobba met up with a
    group of bounty hunters and his story continued to be told in "The Clone Wars" animated series.</p>
